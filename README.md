⦁	   Introduction
This section provides an initial introduction for the mobile application which is going to be developed with standard network protocols and security measures to deal with the customers of the construction loan. This application can be used to reduce the risks involved in the loans and their process reducing the financial risk in the bank. Good data management with securing the privacy of the customers is addressed in the section as well as in the project.
⦁	Basic overview of the project
Usually, there are applications in the banking sector to transfer money and pay bills. In most of the applications, there are features in applying for bank loans too. A very famous bank loan scheme is construction loans in the banking sector. Simply, the borrower gets the loan against a property owned by the borrower. Though it looks simple in the terms, there is a huge operation behind that loan process. Customers should visit the bank several times and the bank should validate and evaluate the customer properly to grant the loan. The obvious security that the bank has in their hand is the property or the deed of the property. Usually, in the process of granting the loan, the bank converts the ownership of that property to the bank from the borrower at the beginning of the process. 
The hidden issue in this process is that the financial risk and the credit risk appeared in this process. Because, in the modern days, there are a lot of customers have shown to be suddenly got discontinued this bank loan wasting the bank’s time and cost as well as the borrowers time and cost. Because, these construction loans are issued by the banks to the customer stagewise. After granting the initial amount of the loan, the customer should be able to build whatever the building which he or she mentioned in the beginning of the loan process and provide the evidences to the bank in order to get the second portion of the bank loan. At this stage, due to the lack of knowledge and the lack of abilities of management, the customer loses their eligibility to get the second portion of the loan making the bank officers in trouble, because they have to provide explanations to the management and show reasons for not being able to keep the loan underperforming category. To address this issue, a practical solution was needed. 
This research is done using latest mobile development frameworks and security protocols since the most important feature in this kind of an application should be the security.
⦁	   Aim and objectives
⦁	Aim
To design a web application and a mobile application to monitor the construction loan progress of the borrowers in order to reduce the financial risks which are faced by the bank. In addition to that, to open a secured channel by following standard data security methods, to individually monitor the customer and provide solutions as quickly as possible to secure the continuation of the bank loan.

⦁	Objectives

⦁	To critically analyze the requirement of a monitoring system to monitor construction loan process of Sri Lankan banks.
⦁	To select a sensitive sector where sensitive data is transferred between service provider and the service receiver.
⦁	To implement data security measures to provide a better service by closely monitoring the customers. 
⦁	To reduce human-intervene in inspections of such financial activities using an automated system. 
⦁	To develop a web application and a mobile application to monitor construction loans and its progress allowing the customers to upload construction photos and invoices in order the bank to measure the progress with trusted evidence.
⦁	To validate such evidences using location tracking technologies and data protection strategies.
⦁	   Background and motivation

Current loan schemes introduced by the central bank has got benefits to the customers and challenges to the banking sector as well. Specially, when a personal loan is considered, that loan is issued at once and the installment repayment is monitored in a simple method and only when the customer fails to repay 3 or more installments, bank usually start investigations. In such a loan, the repayment amount and the date are the facts to be monitored and analyzed. Due to such underperforming loans, bank tend to fail to achieve the expected goals in a particular period. 
When the construction loan is considered, as per the regulations, the loan is issued in several stages. At the initial stage, construction estimates and forecasted quotations are studied in order to define the suitability of the customer to grant the loan to. But in the second release stage of the loan, the construction progress is studied and analyzed to decide whether to issue the second phase of the loan or not. To do this, an officer has to visit the construction location to monitor the required parameters and to decide the current construction progress is acceptable to release the second stage of the loan. 
There are cases, where the initial loan amount has been used partly for the construction and another part to some other requirements of the customer. In such cases, the bank has to explain them the rules and regulations of the bank in order to secure the second phase of the loan issuance. To monitor this, a sophisticated system should be designed to introduce rules and regulations to the customer eventually and to monitor the progress of the construction as well as the repayment progress. By doing to, the level of the customer can be analyzed based on the construction progress and the repayment progress automatically. This analysis can be done individually with a higher accuracy as well as in a short period of time. So, bank can automatically forecast the monthly profits without any extra effort. Through this process, the bank can foresee the expected revenue during a particular period and take necessary actions to find remedies for treatable issues. 

⦁	   Problem in brief

Borrowers who are taking construction loans are not properly fulfil the bank’s requirements. That might have been the reason of the unawareness of the procedures. Generally, construction loans are granted to the borrowers on step wise basis system. Initially, the borrower is analyzed using his or her repayment abilities. After considering the potentials of the borrower, the bank issues the bank loan. But this happens step wise. Initially, a predefined amount is issued to the borrower. This borrower should be able to do the pre-proposed construction phase using this amount and provide evidences of the construction and prove that the construction phase one has been done properly using the amount he or she received. Then the bank analyses the work and the financial management proceedings. After that, the bank issues the next phase of the construction loan. Then the borrower has to do the same. 
In this process, due to the unawareness of the proper practice of the loan utilizing process, most of the construction loan customers are losing their second phase of the loan. Usually, a bank officer visits the construction site and the progress reports to the bank. If that is not up to the satisfactory standards, the bank does not issue the second part. This leads the borrower to end up with an unsuccessful construction as well as losing the money too. In the other hand, the bank loses their businesses too. Bank launches this construction loan product to earn a profit for them. When they lend the money, they expect a return from it. So, their financial predictions and all the other forecasting are lost. So, the financial cost is becoming higher in the bank. 
To overcome this issue, this solution which is based on the modern technology is proposed.
Does implementing a mobile application in a secured way to monitor the bank loan continuation help to reduce the unsuccessful completion of the construction loan?
Analyzing and utilizing customer information through a secured network by a Mobile Application is proposed to overcome this issue.
⦁	Proposed solution 
The overview of the solution for this issue is Implementing a Mobile application to monitor the construction loan process and the progress collecting customer data through a secured network and manipulating them to assess the customer’s progress of repayment and analyzing the progress of the construction process and re-shaping and re-structuring the process if there are any deviations which cause the customer not to be granted the coming steps of the loan.

Through this application, customers can upload their construction progress photos and invoices of the construction process in order to prove the bank that the construction was conducted properly as quoted and proposed in the beginning of the construction loan application. The bank can analyze the progress of the construction without visiting the place physically because the photos uploaded by the customers are stamped with the GPS location of the photo taken to prove the construction is carried out at the documented location. 

the repayment and other details of the customer can be used to automatically determine the optimum credit facility that the individual customer can get from the bank when there is a critical situation like a pandemic in the country. In addition to that, the bank can utilize the data to measure the credit risk the bank is facing and correct decisions can be taken using that data hence reduce the financial risk involved in the banking process.

⦁	Summary
The main intention of the research is to find a better solution to implement contact less banking even in the construction loan processing and monitoring. Since that product in the bank is something which requires a practical approach and more manpower should be used to process and monitor such loans. This section explained the previous methods which the bank used and the similar approaches where the banks have tried to implement alternative systems to do such operations. Literature review in this chapter covers such possibilities and the gaps in those systems which those countries or banks used earlier. So, to address those gaps in this research and to provide a comprehensive system was intended here and the information utilized to enrich that in this chapter.






















⦁	   Literature review
⦁	Introduction
Since the previous chapters gave an ignition to the research by an introduction, this chapter illustrates a critical review of literature on the application solutions related to the banking systems which are used for data monitoring and manipulation for better performances of the bank as well as the customer. In the coming sections, the problem and the technologies available and suggested by the previous studies are analyzed and explained comparatively. In addition to that, the laws involved in the banking process which are directly affect the system which is going to design in the next chapters, are reviewed with current and previous studies. 
⦁	Requirement of a sophisticated and secured system for decision making in the banking sector.
The requirement of a sophisticated system for a bank is obvious in the current competitive world. The sector has evolved so much with the development of the modern technology and the modern concepts which are developed by the researchers in different entities to surpass the competitors. 
Recovery tasks in the banking sector is sometimes critical when dealing with the customers and the relevant rules and regulations in the country. In such situations, the banking sector is depending on the circulars of the central bank. These circulars are addressing both the bank and the customers. Most of the times, the bank has to implement a system to perform such activity by obeying set of rules and the recovery method has to be defined by the bank following those rules imposed by the central bank. In such cases, conflicts may appear since some of the banks have to consider more practical approaches than just following the instructions fulfilling the authorities. Construction loan scheme is such a situation where some practical activities are included. According to the clause number 2.2 of “Recovery plans for Licensed Commercial Banks and Licensed Specialized Banks” of Banking Act Directions of Monetary Board of Sri Lanka, each and every bank in Sri Lanka should have a recovery plan. That recovery plan’s scope should include sectors which consider the Nature, Complexity, Scale and inter connection of licensed banks and the entities. This shall be covered in the framework of recovery (Banking act directions No 09 of 2021 – 16 June 2021). 
This recovery plan is very sensitive in such situations where there is a pandemic in the country, just like in 2020 and 2021 covid situation. During such conditions, banks have to monitor the customers individually and take decisions in operating monetarism programs. Doing so, the bank can take distributed decisions considering actual situation of the customer.
In such cases where the customer faces difficulties in repayment, concessions are being granted by the central bank of Sri Lanka. Specially, due to the covid situation, central bank has granted such concessions to the customers. To implement this, Central bank Monetary board has issued a circular, which is, Concession for Covid-19 Affected Businesses and Individuals (BSD Circular No 05 of 2021 – 25 May 2021). In these situations, the customer has to request a concession from the bank individually. In this process, corresponding bank is providing a web link or a google sheet to collect the requests and the reasons can be mentioned in the google form. Measuring the validity and the accuracy of such data is difficult. In these situations, if the bank has a monitoring system from the beginning, the bank can monitor the financial activities and the construction activities (if that is a construction loan), using that digital system, and then granting such concessions can be evaluated automatically making the customer and the bank safe. 
⦁	Risks and risk mitigation in the banking sector.
Banking process is always running with the risk involved. With the development of the technology, the appearances of the risks have been changed and new risks have popped out. Information plays a huge role in the banking sector developments. Banks are studying the current situation in the investment market and move into investments. But in such cases, the losses occur, considered as Exogenous shocks, are inevitable just like in Government Sponsored Enterprises (Mac et al., 2014) lost the market share making the banks to loss their profits of their investments since the market share price was dropped in large scale.
Credit risk, operational risk, market risk, legal risk and liquidity risk are considered as the most important risks which are considered as human and operational risks involved in operations (Mirzaei & coworkers, 2011). 
Credit risk is one of the famous risks involved in the banking sector. In most of the cases, customers are taking loans from the bank and the repayment of them would not happen as described and instructed at the stage of lending. In the banking sector this credit risk analysis is done by closely monitoring the credit behavior in order to take future lending decisions. In addition to that, credit risk monitoring is done in decision making in profit enhancement strategies (Angelini, di Tollo, & Roli, 2008). In most of the cases, borrowers are the ones who has a clear picture about the construction that they are planning to build using the loan taken from the bank, but the lenders are not much aware of the particular process that the borrower is going to follow (Matoussi & Abdelmoula, 2009). In such cases, a well-designed system can equalize the construction process of all the borrowers by imposing a standard process to follow in order to gain the next phase of the construction loan by individually analyzing each customer automatically by such a system (Nazari and Alidadi, 2013).
⦁	Monitoring systems implementing in the banking sector and latest studies
With the development of information technologies, IT risk and Strategy risk (Keramati and Shaeri, 2014) have become two of the most important risks to be assessed in the financial sector. Considering that fact, Alibaba has been working on a project to detect fraud risks, monitoring and management fraud risks using big data analysis. They use machine learning to detect fraud risks real time. In this (Chen et al., 2015) system, they collect big set of real time user data and feed them to their specially designed system called AntBuckler. It studies the nature of users and detect any malicious behaviors if there are any. AntBuckler uses an engine called RAIN score, to analyze risk levels quantitatively and display the risk score in their user-friendly interface.
The modern approach which is followed in the current days, there are IOT systems attached with decentralized ledger technologies. This kind of a system provides anti-counterfeiting, traceability, and identification of reliability which is connected to the end to end (Wang, Guo and Cheng, 2019).



⦁	Similar smart solutions for practical problems
Similar smart project solutions are used in many sectors like, manufacturing industry, transportation industry, retail industry and banking and many more. As mentioned in the (Fata, 2015), this research has been done to make a system to monitor the operations of a production line in a manufacturing plant. This so-called system has been named as MobilERP. It has been designed to coop with any manufacturing process. Basically, this system is used to trace the items in the production line using a mobile application. The tracing part is done using a smart phone application and the management is done using a desktop application. The whole system is based on three main components, which are android mobile application, database and desktop application. Using these three components, the management can easily trace the items and their locations, production quality and production efficiency easily. This data accumulation leads the management to do a lot of studies of their companies and use the data to analyze the future trends and improve the available quality of this whole process. The database design has been done using UML design techniques and that has shown a versatile outcome in the industry. The researcher has made sure to operate this in an ethical way using safety and environmentally friendly measures. Showing a complete project procedure, this project has been done along with a financial analysis too.
Apart from that, another one of the best utilizations of smart technologies have been found in this (Hariharan, 2017) research. In this research, which has been done in the California State university, Sacramento, a smart solution has been introduced to do shopping in an easy way. When it comes to shopping rates in United States, most of the people, which is in numbers mentioned as forty million, are shopping in the week ends as mentioned in (Goodman, 2008). That indicates that there are long queues in the shopping malls in the week ends. That is a huge waste of time. Even though people do online shopping, these traditional shopping methods have not yet been stopped or even decreased. The reason behind that is, by most of the super market networks, many coupons and discount cards are issued. There are developed marketing methods imposed to the general public so, they are usually coming to the super markets following traditional ways of shopping. These coupons and other offers are also usually offered in weekends. There are several applications available to use for shopping like LINE HERE, QLess and atQ. They even have features to check the reviews of the item that they are buying. But at the same time people don’t forget to visit the shopping mall to do some traditional shopping. 
So, if an application is developed, for shopping, these factors are also should be applied. There are these limitations like, inability to feel the real shopping experiences or to see what other people buy in these applications. So, if someone can integrate those features or similar ones, they can reduce the large crowd in the shopping malls. It seems that it is not important just to have an application but to have an application to provide a solution for the real problem or the problems that might be occurred in the future too.
Further, mobile applications can be used to accumulate the views of the person hence they can be used to develop or improve the quality of a product. Mobile application development has entered various applications of the day-to-day life of humans. This mobile application is used to educate the customers or the people who are interested about the housing constructions. The basic argument is that if there are defects in the constructions, and if they are found after the constructions by the customers, there is an issue in the quality of the construction or the way that customers see the construction. Not all the customers have the knowledge about the construction industry. So, to provide the necessary knowledge to the customers while taking proper feedback of the construction that the builders are building would save time and the money efficiently. So, this design quality assessment mobile application is used to assess the quality of the construction but before that, this gives the necessary knowledge to the customers to make correct decisions about what they see. 
⦁	Future trends
This field of industries are developing towards a fully digital operation level. Most of the banks are now being exposed to latest methods of digital solutions. To address the risks and the risk mitigation techniques in the banks, and other financial institutions, the decision-making procedures are now moving into the digital solutions based on big data and Artificial Intelligence based applications. As explained in (King, 2003), banking activities are no longer a physical activity, it is not a place to go in the modern day but something human beings do. No matter what the medium is. It also says that FinTech companies might replace banks in the future. As explained by the Skandinaviska Enskilda Bank CEO, Annika Falkengren (2015), those FinTech companies are acting as banks, speaking like banks and the only difference is that they are not regulated like general banks. As stated in this study (Turlais, 2016), these fintech companies have accumulated around 12 billion US dollars in the year 2014. So, this alternative trend is developing with the technology. Since the development of big data related software solutions, most of the banks are forecasting the behavior of the potential customers and the current customers. Doing so, the capacities and the future behavior of the customers are predicted. Doing so, the customized policies and methodologies are introduced to the relevant customer. To do this they are using customized advertisements. This is another method which is connected with the marketing strategies in the present banking system.
These fintech companies are aiming on the following three key areas, such as,
⦁	Service oriented
⦁	Data oriented
⦁	Process oriented
with the development of the current technological applications, above 3 approaches are delivered in a modern technological manner using sophisticated software and mobile applications. It also makes the customers to smoothly perform their activities related to their financial requirements easily.
Another large-scale change in the banking sector is the launching of digital currencies like crypto. This trend has already replaced the conventional currencies and conventional currency notes in most of the business regions of the world. Since these crypto currencies and their behavior is untraceable, most of the customers have started to use them considering its higher level of security. With the development of latest blockchain application systems, the security of such transactions is also improved. People who are working with large amounts of cash is always looking for such requirements like safety and untraceable transactions methods. In this case, there is a trend where the physical consuming of traditional banks and currency notes have been reduced. 
Not only that, even if the customer wants to visit the bank and do physical activities, that is also replicated by some of the tech companies by introducing Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality applications. Using those techniques, the customer is given a virtual environment replicated as exactly the same as the actual banking experience. The VR box does the job by visualizing what it looks like inside the bank at the moment. As far as these technology applications are concerned, these topics like, big data, payments, billing Trading activities, investing, insurance policies, management if identities of the customers, management of loans, lending and its methods and performing the whole banking activities by messaging. The development of the AR and VR systems, have addressed the above features mostly in mobile systems. Not only in the general applications, this AR and VR systems are now implemented in the military applications to replicate the real war zones to get the ideas and to produce Realtime decisions in the war (Mekni and Lemieux, 2014). With the development of such technologies, the most important fact that should be considered is the security. So, in the future, there will be new security protocols designed in order to achieve the trust of the users. As Augmented Reality is used in many other fields like, Marketing, Civil Engineering, Robotics, Visualization, Manufacturing, Entertainment industry and navigations, most of the traditional views of the people have become changed. So, this banking system also should be changed to provide and fulfil the customers new requirements. Since this current study is aimed on construction loan monitoring, the application can be developed to visualize the end result of the construction which has planned by the customer. And the progress can be monitored with the help of the AR and VR techniques as the customer and the bank officer has the ability to check and visualize the completed and remaining activities in the construction. The current system has suggested to upload construction photos along with the GPS coordinates, but this kind of a system can be used to monitor not only those features but also some additional features like construction activity visualization. In addition to that, there will be new data security policies developed for the world like General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
⦁	Summary
All these situations see the requirement. Some authorities have taken some policy-based decisions and some has tried to take technology-based decisions. It implies that a system which addresses all these aspects should be the optimum solution for this issue and also it should consist with all the traditional functions of the banking process. Also, those traditional systems should be improved where necessary.
⦁	  Technology
Technologies used to approach to the solution is described here. Initially, to determine the practical problems arise in the current process and to measure the level of priority which has to be considered when designing the system, a data analysis is done. A customer feedback form is issued to the current customers to get the idea of the current bank loan system and the expected changes of the system as suggested by the customers. For this, 100 customers are selected around the country via the branches of the bank.
⦁	Defining the functions of the Mobile Application
To define the functions of the mobile and web applications, current system of the construction loans has to be analyzed. Secondly, the mindset of the borrowers should be assessed in a way from which ideas and suggestions of the borrowers should be collected and analyzed. To do this, a survey (Bagshaw, 2009) should be done and collected data should be analyzed statistically. Data collection process should be covered following aspects,
⦁	Section for identifying if a system process or a property is “Acceptable” or “Not”
⦁	Section for identifying the level of satisfaction of a current process flow.
⦁	Section for identifying the suitability for the ways of usage of customer information and introduce standard networking protocols and data security measures.
⦁	Section for presenting internationally used methods to customers and to get the feedback.
⦁	Section for identifying the feasibility of implementing such a system in the future considering the mobile phone users and a forecasting of their literacy level.
In the data collection phase, borrowers who took the construction loan, are selected. Survey forms are distributed among them and explain them about the needful. Collected data is analyzed using SPSS software to detect any trends. The detected trends can interpret expected functions to be implemented in the mobile and web application. 
Using the expected functions, a requirement analysis is done and the conceptual model is designed. With re-shaping that model, the physical system is designed and implemented. 
⦁	Defining the application development tools and frameworks
⦁	Languages and frameworks
Basic design approach is to use general mobile development platforms and languages like JAVA and FLUTTER or REACT JS. The use of FLUTTER or REACT JS is considered initially to make the application open for both the platforms which are commercially available at the moment. To implement the security and the latest network protocols, both the frameworks are suitable since they are in the final stages of being matured with latest technology.
⦁	Database
Database requirements can be fulfilled by SQL server cloud-based or secured Firebase server. Fire base is a Backend-as-a-server (Baas) developed by google. It can be used as the server, API and the data storing platform. For API services, RESTful web service is used.


⦁	   Design
Design phase is consisted with the set of flow charts (Shneiderman et al. 1977). The basic process plan is mentioned in the below. Additional functions are added to the system to increase the privacy and the network security considering the customer feedbacks during the data collection and analysis phase.

As mentioned earlier, preliminary study has been conducted and the requirement of such a system is identified as essential. Conceptual development is done in the design phase of the study. To support the concept, data analysis is done to determine additional requirements of the consumers of this intended application.
For the data collection, 100 of borrowers are selected and the survey form is distributed with explanation of the required information. in addition to that, 20 of banking officers, who have been visiting such construction sites to inspect the construction progress for next stage of the loan approval processes, are also used for data collection and their practical experiences are noted.
Collected data is analyzed using SPSS software. In this process, alternative ideas are detected considering Correlation analysis and Regression analysis. Using both the mathematical models, mostly related aspects are detected and used for the design of the software. In the design phase, the data protection and security are considered in a higher level.
